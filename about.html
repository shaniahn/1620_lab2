    <h1> Hi, I'm Shaniah </h1>
    <h3>A little bit about me </h3>
    <p> My name is Shaniah Nizzar and in my spare time, I love to take my dog to the park or go to spin class!
        I have my Psychology degree from a combination of two schools: SFU and UVic. I've also taken a year of
        CIT-type courses at UFV; I find that these have helped me in adjusting to the first term of this program.
        I'm hoping that this program will put me on more of a direct career pathway and I'm super excited to 
        work on my logic skills.</p>
